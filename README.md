# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

A complete end-to-end Credit Card Fraud Detection solution combining machine learning, REST API, and a Flutter frontend for real-time transaction analysis.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest models trained on a real-world credit card dataset to detect fraudulent transactions. It applies dynamic threshold tuning for better accuracy and velocity checks to flag suspicious transaction patterns.

The backend is built with Flask, exposing an API that accepts CSV transaction files and returns fraud predictions along with detailed context. A Flutter app serves as the frontend, allowing users to upload transaction data and instantly see fraud detection results and alerts.
